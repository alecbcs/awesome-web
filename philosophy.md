Things in this collection tend to align with the following philosophy.

## The Problem

Many problems with our modern web are downstream of two popular business practices.

The first practice is offering a web-based service to users free-of-charge, then monetizing it with algorithmically-targeted advertising. A close cousin of advertising is pay-for-play schemes (like affiliate marketing). It's also common to collect and sell personal data about users and their behavior. In all of these cases, users end up paying for something not directly (with their money), but indirectly with their attention, neuroplasticity, and private data.
The second practice is spending multiple rounds of investor funding to deliver a service free-of-charge while building sticky network effects or a 'moat' against competition. Then, when investors seek returns, the company "alters the deal" for users who now have reduced ability to switch to another service.

These practices have delayed, harmful effects for individual users, and for the overall health of humanity's information and sense-making commons. When a service provider chases advertising revenue, they are incentivized to pollute the web with engagement-hacked, high-volume, low-quality content. The company is more likely to collect private user data for ad targeting (or sale to data brokers). They are more likely to manipulate and abuse their users' attention.

Similarly, when investors seek return on a service that has operated at a steep loss for years, the relationship with users becomes exploitative as the service holds users' data hostage and breaks its long-standing promises.

## Paths Forward

We believe that a web-based service generally serves users best when it makes revenue from users who pay or donate directly -- _not_ from targeted advertising, selling user data, or pay-for-play schemes. Users get a better experience when they pay for things with their money, not their neuroplasticity or their data.

While pursuit of profit can cause harm, we believe it's healthy for a service to seek steady profitability early in its existence, instead of growth-hacking at a loss.

We believe that paying or donating toward things on the web that you value is like _voting for what you want the world to make more of_. A few dollars sends a much stronger signal than clicking a "like" button. We believe it's time to shift the overton window on paying for things like the the news, music, and even searching the web.

It's always been cool for wealthy people to financially support creative endeavors -- we believe it's time to make patronage cool for _everyone_ who has a few bucks to spare.

When people pay for things like music and books, we believe it's best when they're able to download their own, local, DRM-free copy to keep and enjoy forever. This protects against the company altering the deal in exploitative ways, or shutting down entirely.

We believe it's best when a web-based service is un-opinionated regarding _how_ someone consumes it. You use a niche browser? No problem! You've disabled JavaScript for privacy reasons? That's cool, we'll do our best to keep the site working. You want to `curl` us to read offline? Right on.

Finally, we believe the simplest business models, those most understandable to regular folks, tend to be the most humane.
