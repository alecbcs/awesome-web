# Awesome Web
A human curated collection of websites and internet organizations prioritizing
people over profits.

Awesome Web includes:

- User-paid (or donation-funded) alternatives to services that more commonly rely on targeted advertising or sponsored content.

- Privacy-respecting alternatives to services that most typically collect and monetize data about users and their behavior.

- Marketplaces that sell DRM-free media like books and music.

- Software that gives you the choice of consuming as a service, or exporting the data and hosting it yourself ([credible exit](https://newsletter.squishy.computer/p/credible-exit)).
